## 🖼️ Visual Highlights

### 📘 Week 1 – Excel Essentials: Lookups, Pivot Tables & Segmentation

#### 🔍 VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP Formula in Action

![VLOOKUP Formula Example](Assets/week1_lookup_formula_example.png)  
*Dynamic lookup between tables using VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP to match and retrieve employee details.*

---

#### 📊 Pivot Table: Bike Sales Summary

![Bike Sales Pivot Table](Assets/week1_bike_sales_pivot_table.png)  
*Summarised sales performance by region and product using Excel PivotTables.*

---

#### 🔄 SWITCH Function: Sales Segmentation

![SWITCH Function Example](Assets/week1_switch_function_example.png)  
*Custom sales performance categorisation using SWITCH logic — classifying sales as High, Medium, or Low and linking to segmented summary.*

This week built my foundation in Excel and helped me understand how structured functions and summarisation tools like pivot tables can reveal hidden trends quickly.
---

### 📘 Week 2 – Data Visualisation with Tableau

#### 🎵 Spotify Music Trends Dashboard

![Spotify Dashboard](Assets/week2_tableau_spotify_dashboard.png)  
*Explored listening trends across genres using Tableau — highlighting energy, danceability, and popularity for user engagement insights.*

---

#### 📈 UK Job Change (EMSI Dataset)

![EMSI Job Change Dashboard](Assets/week2_tableau_jobchange_dashboard.png)  
*Visualised employment changes using bar charts and a UK map — highlighting sector impact across major cities.*

---

#### 🏥 NHS Health Insights Dashboard

![NHS Health Dashboard](Assets/week2_tableau_nhs_dashboard.png)  
*Analysed life expectancy, obesity, and cancer rates across regions to support health service planning and trend analysis.*

---

This week helped me develop practical skills in both Tableau and Power BI. I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards that communicated real-world insights from music and healthcare data, while the Power BI labs strengthened my understanding of data loading, transformation, and report design.

---

### 📘 Week 3 – SQL & Relational Database Design

#### 🔄 SQL Join Query Example

![SQL Join Query](Assets/week3_sql_joins.png)  
*Used JOIN operations to combine related tables and retrieve connected data.*

---

#### 🏗️ Database Design & Table Structures

![Database Design](Assets/week3_database_design.png)  
*Outlined the structure of a retail business database using SQL table definitions and explained how relational models support scalable analysis.*

---

#### 📊 SQL Practical Query Outputs

![SQL Query Outputs](Assets/week3_sql_practical_outputs.png)  
*Ran filtering and aggregation queries using real-world datasets to count entries, apply conditions, and explore relationships between data tables.*

---
I gained confidence in relational database design and SQL querying. I used join operations to combine datasets, designed a retail database structure, and ran practical queries to retrieve, filter, and count key data values.

### 📌 Week 5 – Cloud Tools & Architecture

![Cloud Architecture](Assets/week5_cloud_architecture_diagram.png)  
*Mapped modern data pipelines using Azure and visualised retail insights in Power BI.*

I explored how data flows through cloud-based systems and gained a clearer view of where analysts and data engineers fit within that process.
---

### 📌 Week 6 – Python & Visualisation

![GDP Visualisation](Assets/week6_python_gdp_visualisation.png)  
*Wrangled real-world data with Pandas and built charts using matplotlib.*

I discovered how to manipulate large datasets programmatically and use code to generate insights and plots — making Python a powerful tool in my analyst toolkit.
---

## ✅ Skills Developed

- Excel lookups, pivot tables, and automation functions
- RDBMS concepts and SQL query writing
- Power BI dashboarding and DAX basics
- Python for data wrangling and visualisation
